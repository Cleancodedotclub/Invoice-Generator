The React JS Invoice Generator GitHub repo is a project that allows users to create invoices for their businesses. The app has a user-friendly interface and allows users to input customer and product information, as well as calculate tax and discounts. Users can also preview their invoice before saving and printing it in PDF format. The project uses React JS for the front-end and relies on third-party libraries like react-to-print, react-router-dom, and react-hook-form to handle various functionalities. The app also utilizes Firebase for user authentication and data storage. This project is helpful for small business owners who want a quick and efficient way to generate invoices for their clients.
